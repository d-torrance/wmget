wmget is a dock app for the GNU Window Maker window manager (or one of
the many other WM's which support dockapps) which makes it more
convenient to perform long downloads in the background.  It uses the
excellent libcurl library, part of the cURL automated-download program,
to perform file retrieval.

The latest information about and version of wmget will hopefully always
be available at:
    <http://amtrickey.net/wmget/index.html>

Wmget requires libcurl (various versions from 7.5.1 on were used during
development); this is part of the main cURL distribution.  Grab it from:
    <http://curl.haxx.se/>

configure and install it if you don't have it.  And for routine download
tasks, check out their ``curl'' command-line tool.

wmget is written entirely in C.  It (as of 0.4) uses a from-scratch
dockapp library I cooked up for fun.  This replaced a common dockapp
utility library named wmgeneral.c, which helped me get off the ground;
thanks to the authors (Martijn Pieterse & Dave Clark).

The wmget manpage is written in Perl's POD documentation language.  If you
don't have Perl, that's fine; just don't delete and try to remake the
manpage I provided.

I'm releasing my code under the same licensing terms as the X Window
System.  These terms are commonly known as ``MIT'' licensing terms,
since that's where they originated.  I've attached these licensing
terms, and the important non-warranty clauses, below.

Enjoy!
