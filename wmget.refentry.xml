    <title>Description</title>
    <para>
      wmget is a ``dockapp'' which makes it more convenient to
      retrieve files in the background.  Dockapps are applications
      which run in small windows intended to be ``docked'' in window
      manager-provided locations.  wmget was developed primarily under
      GNU Window Maker, the author's preferred WM, but is known to
      work under AfterStep as well, and should work with other
      dockapp-aware window managers and docks.
    </para>
    <para>
      It uses the excellent libcurl library, part of the Curl
      automated-download program, to perform file retrieval from Web
      servers, FTP servers, and other sources.
    </para>
    <para>
      wmget allows you to perform multiple downloads without keeping a
      terminal open (for FTP or curl or something) or another window
      on your desktop (e.g. for Mozilla download progress); download
      progress is visible any time the Dock is visible.
    </para>
    <para>
      You start downloads either by ``pasting'' URLs from Web browsers
      or other applications, or by invoking wmget from the command
      line (or another script or program) with a source URL.  The
      dockapp has a handful of configurable download options, such as
      target directory, HTTP proxy server, etc.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Starting Up</title>
    <para>
      To start the dockapp, just run <command>wmget dock
      &amp;</command>.  If you are running Window Maker, you can then
      just drag the new appicon onto your Dock, right-click on an area
      outside the four progress bars, select
      <guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem>, and select <guilabel>Start
      when Window Maker is started</guilabel>.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you are running AfterStep, you can add it to your Wharf by
      adding the following line to your
      <filename>~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/wharf</filename> file:
    </para>

    <informalfigure>
      <programlisting>
        *Wharf wmget - Swallow "wmget" wmget dock &amp;
      </programlisting>
    </informalfigure>

    <para>
      Other window managers support dockapps in different ways.  Even in
      window managers without any special dockapp support, you can run
      wmget as noted above; it will simply show up as a small window or
      "icon".
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Using wmget</title>
    <para>
      wmget's user interface is simple: four stacked progress bars,
      initially empty, representing four possible simultaneous
      downloads.  The top bar will say ``wmget'' when there isn't a
      download running there, but any download will cover that up.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each running download normally shows up to nine characters of its
      filename, overlaid with a progress bar.  You can click on any
      progress bar to reveal a percentage display and a stop button;
      clicking on the percentage display switches back, while clicking
      on the stop button stops the download.  There is currently no
      confirmation; it just stops.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can ``request'' downloads at any time.  If all four places
      show running downloads, additional requests will queue up, waiting
      for one to complete; wmget will never be downloading more than
      four files at a time.
    </para>
    <para>
      By default, wmget figures out a reasonable filename for any
      requested downloads, writes them to your home directory, and won't
      overwrite an existing file by the same name.  All of these, along
      with a few other options, are configurable.  See below.
    </para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Requesting Downloads with the Mouse</title>
      <para>
        The easiest way to request a download is by copying and pasting
        a link.  wmget lets you paste a URL by middle-clicking anywhere
        on any of its status bars.  Simply copy a link from some other
        source (for example, by right-clicking on a link in Mozilla or
        Netscape and picking <guimenuitem>Copy Link
        Location</guimenuitem>), and middle-click on one of the progress
        meter boxes in wmget.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Requesting Downloads from the Command Line</title>
      <para>
        The <command>wmget</command> command also lets you directly
        request downloads from the command line, or from within a script
        or another program.  The syntax is <command>wmget
        <replaceable>URL</replaceable></command>, plus any of the
        options documented below.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once you run this command, you'll either get an error message or
        a ``job ID''.  The job ID is only useful in conjunction with the
        <command>wmget cancel</command> command.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Download Failures</title>
      <para>
        Downloads can fail for a variety of reasons, from running out of
        disk space to modem hangups.  Since wmget is designed not to
        interrupt your workflow or exceed its little square window, it
        responds to any download error by aborting the download and
        writing an error file to your download directory.  This error
        file has the name <filename>file.ERROR</filename>, where
        <filename>file</filename> is the name of the actual download
        target.  This error file is a plain text file containing
        information on what you were downloading and what went wrong.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Viewing and Canceling Downloads</title>
      <para>
        As noted above, you can see the currently-running downloads in
        the four progress boxes on the dockapp.  Clicking on a bar
        reveals a stop button, and clicking on that stop button cancels
        the download (but leaves the partially-downloaded file on your
        computer).
      </para>
      <para>
        At any time, you can also run the <command>wmget list</command>
        command, which displays all the running downloads as well as any
        queued-up requests.  The listing contains entries like this:
      </para>
<informalfigure><screen
>Job 10 [linux-2.6]: 1658544/33073407 RUNNING
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.0-test6.tar.bz2
=&gt; /home/aaron/DOWNLOAD/linux-2.6.0-test6.tar.bz2
</screen></informalfigure>
      <para>
        What you see in that (admittedly dense) listing are the job ID,
        the name of the download as displayed on the dockapp (surrounded
        in brackets), the progress in bytes, the total bytes to
        download, the current status, the source URL, and the target
        file on your computer.  Whew.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can cancel any requested or running download from the
        command line by specifying <command>wmget cancel
        <replaceable>job-id</replaceable></command>.
      </para>
    </refsect2>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Command-Line Options and the Configuration File</title>
    <para>
      wmget supports a handful of configuration options.  You can
      specify defaults for all downloads by putting them in a
      configuration file or adding command-line options to the
      <command>wmget dock</command> command at startup, or you can
      specify options for one specific download by adding options to the
      <command>wmget <replaceable>URL</replaceable></command> command
      when you request them.  There isn't any way to specify options on
      URLs you paste with the mouse.  Dockapp command-line arguments
      override config-file settings, and per-URL settings override
      dockapp settings.
    </para>
    <para>
      The configuration file is an optional file named
      <filename>.wmgetrc</filename> in your home directory.  If it's
      there, it's parsed by the dockapp at startup.  The syntax is
      simple: one option per line, all options consisting of a name and
      possibly a value.  Blank lines are okay, and lines starting with #
      are ignored (so you can disable options easily).  Option names are
      just the same as the command-line option names given below, except
      you don't put the dashes (``--'') and you can't use the one-letter
      abbreviations.
    </para>

            Specifies where to write downloaded files.  In the config
            file or on the dockapp command line, this can only be used
            to specify your default download directory; it must be an
            existing directory, and if it's not absolute then it is
            assumed to be relative to your home directory.  On a
            specific download request, this can provide an alternate
            save directory or even an alternate filename; in that case,
            a non-absolute path is relative to the default download
            directory.
